This file contains the activity log UI that needs to be added to EmailView.tsx

The activity log should replace the middle and right columns when showActivityLog is true.

Layout:
- Left column: Email folders menu (stays the same)
- Middle + Right combined: Activity log with cards grid

Activity cards:
- Sent (Send icon)
- Delivered (Check icon)
- Opened (Eye icon  
- Clicked (MousePointerClick icon)
- Bounced (AlertCircle icon)
- Replied (Reply icon)

Each card should:
- Have icon at top center
- Label below icon
- Count number
- Be fully clickable
- On click, show list of emails in that category on left, details on right
